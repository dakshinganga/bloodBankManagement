BloodBankManagement

This is a online bloodBankManagement Project that has the basic functionalities of a blood bank.
The front end of thr application is written in Reactjs, the backend of the application is written in expressjs and nodejs.
The database that we used in Postgresql.
To run the project on your local machine first you need to have postgresql and nodejs installed on your system
Then open up the folder into your code editor and run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies.
Run the above command in both the folders.
Then you need to connect your postgres to the server.js file in the backend folder.
The files that consists of the table and the command have not been included by me till the time.
I will add those files in the future , I will also be updating the readme so that you don't see these lines.
As of now you can run the frontend of the application in order to know how the app is structured and to get the idea of how it works.
If ypu like the project do give a star and if you want to contribute to make the project more powerful , you are more than welcome
